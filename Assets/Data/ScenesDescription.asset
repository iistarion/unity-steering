    - Flee
    - Evade
    - Pursue
    m_Values:
    - This scene shows a seek behaviour, which means the capsule will go towards
      the target at max speed without reducing its velocity.\n\nIf the seeker gets
      to the target, it will go past it and then go back to it again and again without
      stopping.
    - This scene shows an arrive behaviour, which means the capsule will go towards
      the target at max speed.\n\nIn this behaviour, the arriving object will reduce
      its velocity linearly once the distance to its objective is less than what
      we set up.
    - This scene shows a flee behaviour.\n\nThis will make the fleeing object to
      just go on the opposite direction from where its target is.
    - 'This scene shows an evade behaviour.\n\nThis is just the opposite of the pursue
      behaviour: we simulate the future position of the target we are evading, and
      go opposite of that future direction.\n\nWe are effectively fleeing from the
      gray sphere.'
    - This scene shows a pursue behaviour.\n\nAlthough similar to the seek behaviour,
      in this case the pursuing object will seek the "future position" of the boid
      it is following, by simulating the position that the object will be after the
      seconds we have configured.\n\nWe are effectively seeking the gray sphere.
